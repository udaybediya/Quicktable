There are three files: one was an admin file and the second was an app file. 

Open the admin file in Chrome, where you enter Ub_18,123 the first time, and then the admin panel is open. Similar to the app, you can enter a similar username and password.

Use the need to change the URL with your domain name and path according to you; otherwise, the app will not retrieve data properly.
